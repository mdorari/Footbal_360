In this android application I used https://football360.ir/ api which I could find using google chrome inspect. I don't have access to their api document so I could add all functions to this app.
In this project, I tried to experiment:
  -fetch data from internet using retrofit library
  -tried to create exact screens using jetpack compose (UI)
  -tried to add shimmer effect to loading content
  -tired to experiment navigation with compose

TODO:
If possible:
find more details of https://football360.ir/ api to add remaining screens

Good to have:
Implement in-app internet explorer to open pages
Add ofline mode to catch some data and load them if user is not online.
