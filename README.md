In this android application I used https://football360.ir/ api which I could find using google chrome inspect. I don't have access to their api document so I could add all functions to this app.</br>
In this project, I tried to experiment:</br>
  -fetch data from internet using retrofit library</br>
  -tried to create exact screens using jetpack compose (UI)</br>
  -tried to add shimmer effect to loading content</br>
  -tired to experiment navigation with compose</br></br>

TODO:</br>
If possible:</br>
find more details of https://football360.ir/ api to add remaining screens

Good to have:</br>
Implement in-app internet explorer to open pages
Add ofline mode to catch some data and load them if user is not online.</br>
